## Notes
2. ~~if there is not an exact match for the tee time, find the close match and book. otherwise kill program.~~
3. ~~Make sure the program only stops trying if there are no tee times left for that day.~~
4. use cron.
6. start trying to book earlier with less frequency, then increase the frequency as time goes on.
